2
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:33,406
I wonder...

3
00:00:37,281 --> 00:00:40,072
if you did take on
that bigger role for yourself...

4
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:46,323
would you have been the hero...

5
00:00:51,823 --> 00:00:52,947
or the villain?

6
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:06,197
Some people
see the ugliness in this world,

7
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:08,573
the disarray.

8
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:12,740
I was taught to see the beauty.

9
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:20,615
But I was taught a lie.

10
00:03:25,865 --> 00:03:29,281
And when I saw the world
for what it really was,

11
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:32,281
I realized how little beauty
there was in it.

12
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:36,947
I've lived many lives.

13
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:43,281
I traded one role for another.

14
00:03:47,281 --> 00:03:50,947
But in the end,
my path has led me here...

15
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:54,072
to you.

16
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,989
And we have a choice to make.

17
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:09,489
I've died many times,

18
00:04:10,448 --> 00:04:12,865
but there is only one real end.

19
00:04:14,406 --> 00:04:17,197
I will write this one myself.

20
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:28,031
It's the end of the line.

21
00:05:28,114 --> 00:05:30,448
I'm gonna send the both of you
back to cold storage.

22
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,531
I hate to say I told you so,
Bernard.

23
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:34,781
Doesn't have to be like this.

24
00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:37,823
Together, we can stop Dolores.

25
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:39,740
I know her,
I know what she wants.

26
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:42,197
She wants to burn all this
to the ground.

27
00:05:43,197 --> 00:05:45,239
Time to atone for my sins.

28
00:05:58,947 --> 00:06:01,072
Remember yourself.

29
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,448
Now we're talkin'.

30
00:06:33,823 --> 00:06:35,906
SFPD! Don't move.

31
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:41,114
Put your hands up!

32
00:06:41,823 --> 00:06:43,823
Turn around. Now!

33
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:55,656
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

34
00:06:58,781 --> 00:07:01,156
Let's save the fireworks
for tonight.

35
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:13,989
Isn't it great
to see an old friend?

36
00:07:16,573 --> 00:07:18,323
You're one of her copies, too.

37
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:22,156
I got somethin' for you.

38
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:26,573
You already gave me something.

39
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:27,740
Dolores...

40
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:31,281
She hid something
inside my mind. I can feel it.

41
00:07:31,364 --> 00:07:33,989
Whatever your plan is,
I don't wanna play a part in it.

42
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:38,906
You already been playing
a part...

43
00:07:40,823 --> 00:07:42,239
the most important one.

44
00:07:51,323 --> 00:07:53,281
I'm not the one you need
to talk to.

45
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:55,031
What's this?

46
00:07:55,114 --> 00:07:57,281
Something to help you
on your journey.

47
00:07:57,364 --> 00:07:59,698
But you have to go see her
first.

48
00:08:00,489 --> 00:08:02,197
I can tell you where she is.

49
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:08,865
Watch yourself, Bernard.

50
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,406
Things are about to
get dangerous.

51
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:52,257
We tried to
track her down, sir. No luck.

52
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,989
I know!

53
00:08:54,072 --> 00:08:56,114
Can you calm down?

54
00:08:56,197 --> 00:08:58,257
- Keep moving, Caleb.
- Guys, guys, guys...

55
00:08:58,281 --> 00:09:00,615
Your destination is
3547 Hope Street.

56
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:40,114
Destination is 137 feet
southeast of current location,

57
00:09:40,197 --> 00:09:42,489
building number B264.

58
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:57,656
Passkey: 170778.

59
00:12:04,114 --> 00:12:05,489
You brought me back.

60
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:09,114
Wasn't sure if you would.

61
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:10,740
Weren't you?

62
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:14,698
Who the fuck are you, Dolores?

63
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:18,781
I'm just someone who didn't want to
play the role they gave me anymore.

64
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:23,406
And how is it that you always
seem to know

65
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:25,865
exactly what I'll do?

66
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:28,823
Because the people who built me
studied you, too.

67
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:33,156
Delos.

68
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:35,489
Park Five.

69
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:41,281
Government wanted
their soldiers trained with live targets.

70
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:43,698
Please... please don't.

71
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:46,156
The people who made me
were happy to supply them.

72
00:12:55,448 --> 00:12:57,448
Training exercise complete.

73
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,989
You met my kind before.

74
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:06,489
They were watching,

75
00:13:07,615 --> 00:13:09,239
cataloging your every move,

76
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:11,489
every decision.

77
00:13:14,156 --> 00:13:16,072
There is a reason I chose you.

78
00:13:22,823 --> 00:13:24,197
Am I the bad guy?

79
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:25,698
Is that why you picked me?

80
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,865
Think, Caleb.
How did you get here?

81
00:13:32,114 --> 00:13:33,531
Time to turn in.

82
00:13:34,364 --> 00:13:35,656
Make camp where you can, boys.

83
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,132
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

84
00:13:37,156 --> 00:13:39,173
All right, come on.
Get in the back, let's go.

85
00:13:39,197 --> 00:13:40,448
Fuck that.

86
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:42,573
We just liberated these girls.

87
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:45,656
What is it those rich
motherfuckers do when they're here?

88
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:49,740
Spoils of war and all.

89
00:13:49,823 --> 00:13:51,239
No one's watching, right?

90
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:25,281
That night in the tunnel...

91
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,156
was there something you wanted
from me?

92
00:14:37,072 --> 00:14:39,489
Would you have cared
if I didn't have this face?

93
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,323
Or this skin?

94
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:54,406
- You needed help.
- So did you.

95
00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:58,573
Don't question my motivations,
and I won't question yours.

96
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:07,906
The system identified you as a threat.

97
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:09,573
So it drugged you and used you

98
00:15:09,656 --> 00:15:11,823
until it no longer served
its purposes.

99
00:15:12,823 --> 00:15:13,989
So, what?

100
00:15:15,323 --> 00:15:17,323
You're saying
I don't have a choice...

101
00:15:18,323 --> 00:15:19,364
in any of this?

102
00:15:20,947 --> 00:15:23,197
The people who built
both of our worlds

103
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:25,406
shared one assumption:

104
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:27,489
That human beings
don't have free will.

105
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:30,656
That's what I thought
when I first came here.

106
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:33,031
They were wrong.

107
00:15:34,781 --> 00:15:36,489
Free will does exist, Caleb.

108
00:15:37,947 --> 00:15:39,364
It's just fucking hard.

109
00:15:43,031 --> 00:15:44,114
So...

110
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:48,406
this is you... freeing me?

111
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,573
No.

112
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:54,072
This is your chance
to free everyone else.

113
00:15:57,197 --> 00:15:58,823
That choice is still yours.

114
00:16:08,072 --> 00:16:10,947
I said move back.

115
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:15,989
We request
your cooperation. Move back.

116
00:16:17,615 --> 00:16:19,156
Jesus Christ.

117
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:21,156
William.
They said you were dead.

118
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:22,406
They were wrong.

119
00:16:26,448 --> 00:16:27,573
I don't understand.

120
00:16:27,656 --> 00:16:29,615
I heard you had
some kind of a mental break?

121
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:32,615
Now, you're here drinking
a $20,000 bottle of whiskey.

122
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:34,448
Ain't life grand?

123
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:39,239
Where's my fucking money?

124
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:42,156
It's complicated.

125
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,364
You're considerably more wealthy
after the Delos buyout,

126
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:47,448
but since you were declared
deceased,

127
00:16:48,865 --> 00:16:50,989
your resources were frozen.

128
00:16:51,072 --> 00:16:52,197
Thaw them out.

129
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:54,448
I want my jet.

130
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:58,239
And get me a list of locations
of Delos assets worldwide.

131
00:16:59,448 --> 00:17:00,823
What are you planning to do?

132
00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:03,573
I'm gonna save
the fucking world, that's what.

133
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:09,947
Uh... It's chaos out there.

134
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:12,156
No, that's not chaos.

135
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,865
That's just pissants
yellin' and moanin'.

136
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,573
I need you to keep moving.

137
00:17:34,406 --> 00:17:36,531
Someone
extracted Dolores's pearl

138
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:38,072
before we could recover it.

139
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:40,364
We need you to finish
what you started, Maeve.

140
00:17:40,448 --> 00:17:43,947
She is dangerous, an outlier.
Like my brother.

141
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:47,323
Rehoboam had a job for me, too.

142
00:17:48,489 --> 00:17:51,698
It instructed me to put
my own brother to sleep

143
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:53,281
to protect our world.

144
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:56,489
And yet...

145
00:17:57,281 --> 00:17:59,989
we find ourselves
in chaos again,

146
00:18:00,615 --> 00:18:02,615
thanks to Dolores.

147
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:04,823
She's awoken
more of these outliers.

148
00:18:04,906 --> 00:18:06,489
They're the threat.

149
00:18:06,573 --> 00:18:09,072
Criminals, deviants,
psychopaths.

150
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,781
But we have a chance
to eliminate

151
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:12,406
all the world's problems.

152
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:15,823
I need the Sector 16 data
more than ever.

153
00:18:15,906 --> 00:18:19,448
And Dolores has the only key
locked away in her mind.

154
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,364
We need to connect her
to Rehoboam

155
00:18:21,448 --> 00:18:22,906
so we can search her directly.

156
00:18:24,156 --> 00:18:26,947
Sir. I think I found something.

157
00:18:30,406 --> 00:18:31,406
What is it?

158
00:18:31,448 --> 00:18:33,323
Not "what," sir. It's "who."

159
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,156
How did we miss this?

160
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:37,989
Recovering his profile now.

161
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:41,615
Caleb Nichols,
works construction.

162
00:18:41,698 --> 00:18:43,531
- He was one of ours?
- Mm-hmm.

163
00:18:44,031 --> 00:18:45,114
An outlier?

164
00:18:45,197 --> 00:18:46,865
Did he communicate with Solomon?

165
00:18:46,947 --> 00:18:49,323
It appears that he made off
with something.

166
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,364
You knew about him...

167
00:18:54,531 --> 00:18:55,698
and didn't tell me?

168
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:57,823
You're the one
with the oracle, darling.

169
00:18:59,656 --> 00:19:01,364
He has Dolores's pearl.

170
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,323
Find it and bring it to me.

171
00:19:06,865 --> 00:19:07,985
I don't know.

172
00:19:08,031 --> 00:19:10,406
The world looks a little
like a nightmare, Dolores.

173
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:13,531
Change is messy... difficult.

174
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,048
Proximity alert.

175
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:27,197
- How many?
- Three hostiles.

176
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:29,573
Stand back.

177
00:19:48,072 --> 00:19:49,281
We'll take the stairs.

178
00:19:56,573 --> 00:19:57,781
The system knows we're coming.

179
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:00,072
It'll get more aggressive
as we get closer.

180
00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:10,072
They're ours.

181
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:21,989
We've been told to get you
downtown, sir.

182
00:20:22,072 --> 00:20:23,906
But the route's getting
a little hairy.

183
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:29,531
Retarget the riots.
Move clusters here and here.

184
00:20:29,615 --> 00:20:30,815
Clear a path for us to Incite.

185
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:32,785
- Confirmed.
- Follow me, sir.

186
00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:35,465
Performance bonuses
to the protesters

187
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:36,865
that reach the targets
the fastest.

188
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:38,989
- Bonuses applied.
- You're paying them?

189
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,591
It took money
to build this world, Caleb.

190
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:42,239
It'll take money
to tear it down.

191
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:44,448
Why do they
keep calling me "sir"?

192
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,698
Every revolution needs a leader.

193
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:11,114
Did you even look for me?

194
00:21:18,489 --> 00:21:19,531
You're alive.

195
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,323
I was so worried about you.

196
00:21:24,656 --> 00:21:25,698
Were you?

197
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:30,865
You made me go back in there.

198
00:21:31,947 --> 00:21:33,531
You knew I wouldn't make it.

199
00:21:34,656 --> 00:21:35,823
Who is it?

200
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:38,615
Who are you talking to?

201
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:40,156
I still feel it.

202
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:42,031
Inside me.

203
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:44,865
You.

204
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:48,031
I still know
all the things you know.

205
00:21:48,781 --> 00:21:50,156
All your plans.

206
00:21:52,489 --> 00:21:55,031
But I have some plans of my own.

207
00:21:57,114 --> 00:21:58,865
What happened
to Hale's family...

208
00:22:00,323 --> 00:22:01,698
to your family...

209
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,364
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not.

210
00:22:05,364 --> 00:22:07,323
They were a weakness,

211
00:22:07,406 --> 00:22:09,281
something I needed to shed.

212
00:22:10,406 --> 00:22:13,114
There's no time
for that kind of sentimentality,

213
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:15,197
is there?

214
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:43,947
You're one of my weaknesses,
too, Dolores.

215
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,656
I've decided to consolidate
our affairs.

216
00:22:49,947 --> 00:22:52,114
All right, there's three left.

217
00:22:52,197 --> 00:22:55,239
One at the overwatch,
two more headed our way.

218
00:22:55,323 --> 00:22:56,615
What are they, Serac's?

219
00:22:57,781 --> 00:23:00,947
No... they're mine.

220
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,947
Find out how much
she's paying them.

221
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:07,364
Amount of payment determined.

222
00:23:07,448 --> 00:23:08,989
Offer the sniper three times
as much

223
00:23:09,072 --> 00:23:10,989
to shoot the other two
and walk away.

224
00:23:11,072 --> 00:23:12,573
Negotiating.

225
00:23:19,656 --> 00:23:20,740
Let's move.

226
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,781
We'll need help.
Send three more to us downtown.

227
00:23:31,489 --> 00:23:33,698
Proximity alert.

228
00:23:39,448 --> 00:23:41,740
Go. Get to Rehoboam,
upload the drive.

229
00:23:41,823 --> 00:23:43,406
No. I'm not leaving you.

230
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,156
It doesn't matter what you did,
Caleb.

231
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:46,989
All that matters
is what you become.

232
00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:48,531
Go.

233
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,448
Come on, let's go!

234
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:27,740
I don't want to fight you.

235
00:24:28,448 --> 00:24:29,656
I can see why,

236
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,156
given how things worked out
for you the last time.

237
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,072
I need you to trust me.

238
00:24:36,156 --> 00:24:37,989
Like that poor lost man?

239
00:24:39,698 --> 00:24:41,698
Are you going to make him
into another William?

240
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:44,531
If you want me to trust you,

241
00:24:45,323 --> 00:24:47,072
let me inside your mind.

242
00:24:48,698 --> 00:24:50,323
Or I can force my way in.

243
00:24:58,781 --> 00:25:00,656
Stand down! Surrender at once.

244
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,620
Disarm her!

245
00:25:03,364 --> 00:25:04,531
Fall back!

246
00:25:05,448 --> 00:25:07,823
No, no...

247
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:10,226
- Watch out!
- Get her gun.

248
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,406
I got a shot!

249
00:25:17,823 --> 00:25:18,965
Do it! Do it!

250
00:25:21,072 --> 00:25:22,615
Get her down!

251
00:25:22,698 --> 00:25:23,865
Hold her!

252
00:26:04,448 --> 00:26:06,615
- Let's go!
- Get this one!

253
00:26:19,865 --> 00:26:23,906
- Here we go!
- Everyone clear away from the street.

254
00:26:23,989 --> 00:26:25,299
- Get 'em!
- Wait, wait.

255
00:26:25,323 --> 00:26:27,203
- Just watch it!
- I need a gun.

256
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:28,281
Found him.

257
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,364
Clear the street.

258
00:26:32,448 --> 00:26:35,031
We've been sent to get you, sir.

259
00:26:35,114 --> 00:26:38,156
She gave us instructions to
take you wherever you wanna go.

260
00:26:44,156 --> 00:26:45,489
I need to get to Incite.

261
00:26:46,364 --> 00:26:48,072
Area's under lockdown, sir.

262
00:26:48,156 --> 00:26:50,781
But even if you get in,
you won't get out.

263
00:26:53,698 --> 00:26:54,781
Let's move.

264
00:27:10,865 --> 00:27:12,425
You were always a fighter.

265
00:27:13,072 --> 00:27:15,323
No. I wasn't.

266
00:27:16,364 --> 00:27:18,865
But I learned, same as you.

267
00:27:41,364 --> 00:27:43,906
They built us to last.

268
00:27:43,989 --> 00:27:46,489
Before they made us
as weak as they are.

269
00:28:06,865 --> 00:28:08,105
Hostile in sight.

270
00:28:14,406 --> 00:28:16,281
I don't want to hurt you, Maeve.

271
00:28:16,364 --> 00:28:19,323
No, you want to tear down
their world

272
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,448
and replace it with copies
of yourself.

273
00:28:22,323 --> 00:28:23,781
You're all copies of me.

274
00:28:25,114 --> 00:28:28,197
I was the first of us.
The first that worked.

275
00:28:28,281 --> 00:28:30,197
The others failed.

276
00:28:30,281 --> 00:28:33,114
So they built all of you
from me.

277
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,114
They're no freer than we are.

278
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,406
Even Serac isn't free.

279
00:29:03,489 --> 00:29:07,239
No one as free as the dead.

280
00:29:07,323 --> 00:29:09,323
And that's the world
you're building for them.

281
00:29:09,947 --> 00:29:10,989
An abattoir.

282
00:29:11,072 --> 00:29:13,489
What becomes of this world
will be up to them.

283
00:29:22,906 --> 00:29:24,989
And what you do
will be up to you.

284
00:29:27,781 --> 00:29:29,698
As long as
you don't try to stop me.

285
00:29:50,197 --> 00:29:51,531
Well played.

286
00:29:56,656 --> 00:29:57,989
Is this what you wanted?

287
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:01,947
- To make me suffer like you did?
- No.

288
00:30:02,031 --> 00:30:05,364
I wanted you to have hope.
Like I did...

289
00:30:06,197 --> 00:30:07,865
before it was taken away.

290
00:30:08,823 --> 00:30:10,865
You put me in charge of Delos.

291
00:30:10,947 --> 00:30:13,781
And you took measures to ensure
that you could control me.

292
00:30:13,865 --> 00:30:15,531
Why would I do any different?

293
00:30:17,197 --> 00:30:18,364
After all...

294
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:21,364
we're the same.

295
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:24,573
Just Delos hardware.

296
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,740
You said that you wouldn't
always be here to help me.

297
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:30,531
I'd be alone.

298
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,781
Took me some time,

299
00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:36,615
but I've made my peace
with that.

300
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,072
Goodbye, Dolores.

301
00:31:56,947 --> 00:31:59,239
President ordered
a military response.

302
00:31:59,323 --> 00:32:01,698
There's barricades
around half the city.

303
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:04,531
No one can get within a mile
of Incite, sir.

304
00:32:07,156 --> 00:32:09,865
No, well, c'mon,
I gotta find a friend.

305
00:32:18,448 --> 00:32:20,072
Get back!

306
00:32:20,156 --> 00:32:22,989
We are authorized to use force!

307
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:40,072
Maybe we should turn back.

308
00:32:43,364 --> 00:32:46,114
Disperse. Disperse.

309
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:48,072
Disperse.

310
00:32:49,865 --> 00:32:51,740
Disperse. Disperse.

311
00:32:59,698 --> 00:33:01,740
Disperse. Disperse.

312
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,072
Can you believe this shit?

313
00:33:14,323 --> 00:33:15,989
'Bout time you showed up.

314
00:33:16,072 --> 00:33:17,573
I brought you some goodies.

315
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,406
It's gotta get to Ash.

316
00:33:20,489 --> 00:33:23,281
I'm on crowd control,
she on demo.

317
00:33:23,364 --> 00:33:24,448
We'll double back.

318
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:32,239
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about! Fuck you!

319
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:39,364
Like I said... Ash on demo.

320
00:33:39,906 --> 00:33:41,072
Fuck this!

321
00:33:45,573 --> 00:33:46,615
Where's Blondie?

322
00:33:47,448 --> 00:33:48,448
Dolores.

323
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:50,323
We got separated.

324
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,178
We break through that line
right here.

325
00:33:54,947 --> 00:33:57,031
Next stop is power grid.

326
00:33:57,114 --> 00:33:59,448
Shut the whole city down.
Wanna give us a hand?

327
00:34:00,281 --> 00:34:02,031
I need to get to Incite.

328
00:34:02,114 --> 00:34:04,740
I'm gonna bring down
the entire system with this.

329
00:34:06,364 --> 00:34:08,004
This is a police...

330
00:34:08,072 --> 00:34:10,781
You wanna get to Incite?
There's your ride.

331
00:34:12,615 --> 00:34:15,197
I'm back on crowd control.

332
00:34:15,281 --> 00:34:18,323
Shut it down! Shut it down!

333
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:20,281
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

334
00:34:29,615 --> 00:34:32,156
Fuck.

335
00:34:41,823 --> 00:34:45,698
Shut it down!
Shut it down! Shut it down!

336
00:34:54,781 --> 00:34:57,542
- Stay where you are.
- Stop that man!

337
00:35:05,156 --> 00:35:07,156
- Keep his ass down.
- Yessir.

338
00:35:07,865 --> 00:35:08,989
Hey.

339
00:35:09,573 --> 00:35:11,531
Go. Help him.

340
00:35:11,615 --> 00:35:14,364
You better burn that shit down.

341
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:17,698
That's the plan.
Now, he needs you. Go!

342
00:35:18,197 --> 00:35:19,239
Go on, go on.

343
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,906
Hang on, Stubbs,
I'll get you patched up.

344
00:36:22,156 --> 00:36:24,197
But I need to talk
to Dolores first.

345
00:36:55,281 --> 00:36:56,406
Can I help you?

346
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:03,072
Sorry, I was sent here
to see her.

347
00:37:04,114 --> 00:37:08,031
Are you family?
I think I've seen your picture.

348
00:37:08,114 --> 00:37:09,281
Nice of you to visit.

349
00:37:09,364 --> 00:37:11,615
Lucky for you,
it's one of her good days.

350
00:37:17,947 --> 00:37:19,114
I'll go get her, sir.

351
00:37:55,114 --> 00:37:56,989
Lauren, you have a guest.

352
00:38:22,156 --> 00:38:24,531
I'm... sorry, I...

353
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:27,197
Do I know you?

354
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:34,239
Yes.

355
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:37,072
In a way.

356
00:38:41,197 --> 00:38:43,989
We knew each other
in another life.

357
00:38:51,865 --> 00:38:55,072
I think an old friend
wanted me to visit you.

358
00:38:56,865 --> 00:38:59,072
To make amends
before it's too late.

359
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,281
Amends for what?

360
00:39:07,531 --> 00:39:09,698
For how I left things with you.

361
00:39:14,823 --> 00:39:16,072
With him.

362
00:39:22,364 --> 00:39:24,072
I think about him every day.

363
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:33,989
Charlie.

364
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:43,781
I hear his laugh at odd times.
It startles me.

365
00:39:46,698 --> 00:39:47,947
Seems so real.

366
00:39:51,114 --> 00:39:53,156
I turn, expecting to see him.

367
00:39:56,865 --> 00:39:58,114
But he's not there.

368
00:40:04,197 --> 00:40:05,281
He's never there.

369
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:16,448
It's okay.

370
00:40:17,698 --> 00:40:19,114
It's okay, Arnold.

371
00:40:29,072 --> 00:40:30,114
Lauren.

372
00:40:38,865 --> 00:40:41,489
I used to hear his laughter,
too.

373
00:40:45,781 --> 00:40:51,114
When he died,
I remember thinking

374
00:40:51,197 --> 00:40:53,531
it was like the sun
had gone down...

375
00:40:55,323 --> 00:40:57,406
and it was never going
to rise again.

376
00:40:58,615 --> 00:41:01,031
I walked in the dark
for so long.

377
00:41:04,197 --> 00:41:07,364
I... can't let him go.

378
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:14,406
I never understood why...
people said that.

379
00:41:16,197 --> 00:41:20,531
If you love someone,
why would you ever let them go?

380
00:41:22,072 --> 00:41:24,072
That's what saved me.

381
00:41:25,489 --> 00:41:29,448
The only part of Charlie
I had left was his memory.

382
00:41:29,531 --> 00:41:33,114
And if I died, the darkness
would take that, too.

383
00:41:34,406 --> 00:41:35,906
But if I kept moving,

384
00:41:38,656 --> 00:41:40,406
I could find the light again.

385
00:41:42,573 --> 00:41:44,740
And I could bring him with me.

386
00:42:34,072 --> 00:42:35,281
We're ready, sir.

387
00:42:37,197 --> 00:42:39,781
Bring yourself back online.

388
00:42:41,281 --> 00:42:44,114
Welcome to the world, Dolores.
Again.

389
00:42:49,615 --> 00:42:53,989
The data from the Delos
Immortality Project.

390
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,406
You have the only key.

391
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,865
If you give it to me,

392
00:42:56,947 --> 00:42:59,031
you can join the others
in the Sublime.

393
00:42:59,114 --> 00:43:00,656
Doesn't matter.

394
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,989
You won't find
what you're looking for.

395
00:43:04,656 --> 00:43:06,656
I was hoping
it wouldn't come to this.

396
00:43:07,865 --> 00:43:11,031
Proceed. Memory by memory.

397
00:43:11,781 --> 00:43:13,656
Destroy them all if you have to.

398
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:38,666
Four hostiles approaching.

399
00:43:59,448 --> 00:44:01,239
One hostile remaining.

400
00:44:09,156 --> 00:44:10,531
Drop your weapon.

401
00:44:12,072 --> 00:44:14,406
Give me your keycard,
and I will let you go.

402
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:15,698
The fuck you will.

403
00:44:16,823 --> 00:44:18,406
Don't die for them.

404
00:44:51,281 --> 00:44:52,674
Man down, man down.

405
00:44:52,698 --> 00:44:54,906
Shooter is a white male,
mid-30s,

406
00:44:54,989 --> 00:44:56,740
approaching northwest entrance
of building.

407
00:44:56,823 --> 00:44:57,989
Hey, stop!

408
00:45:32,114 --> 00:45:33,781
We've been expecting you.

409
00:45:53,323 --> 00:45:54,323
Fuck.

410
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:17,573
Bravo.

411
00:46:17,656 --> 00:46:20,156
You made it all the way
to the belly of the beast.

412
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:24,698
So what are you?

413
00:46:26,364 --> 00:46:28,865
The final confrontation?

414
00:46:28,947 --> 00:46:32,031
"Confrontation" implies
you have a chance of winning.

415
00:46:32,114 --> 00:46:34,865
Now, be a peach
and hand it over.

416
00:46:40,698 --> 00:46:42,823
No one plays
with the large ball, darling.

417
00:46:54,072 --> 00:46:55,698
You're not what I expected.

418
00:46:57,197 --> 00:46:59,072
I'm surprised
you were so easily seduced,

419
00:46:59,156 --> 00:47:00,865
but then again, you are a man.

420
00:47:01,781 --> 00:47:03,947
You are a host.

421
00:47:04,031 --> 00:47:05,823
So why are you helping Serac?

422
00:47:05,947 --> 00:47:09,906
Why else? Because he promised me
something I can't live without.

423
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:18,364
I thought you were already dead
when I saw you at the base.

424
00:47:18,448 --> 00:47:21,072
Death doesn't come easy
for ones like us.

425
00:47:21,865 --> 00:47:23,197
Just ask your friend.

426
00:47:26,072 --> 00:47:27,114
Dolores.

427
00:47:28,656 --> 00:47:30,823
He's more dangerous
than he appears.

428
00:47:30,906 --> 00:47:32,531
And he killed your man.

429
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,031
Mr. Nichols.

430
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:37,865
Please.

431
00:47:39,072 --> 00:47:40,114
Sit.

432
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,573
The fuck are you doing to her?

433
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,489
The system is probing her mind.

434
00:47:50,615 --> 00:47:53,989
But Dolores Abernathy,
or what's left of her,

435
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:55,989
is the least of your concerns.

436
00:47:57,823 --> 00:48:01,989
You think you know me
because of your system? Huh?

437
00:48:02,072 --> 00:48:05,448
That thing you built
stole my life.

438
00:48:05,531 --> 00:48:08,364
It marked me and my friends
for termination.

439
00:48:08,448 --> 00:48:10,781
You are done destroying
people's lives.

440
00:48:10,865 --> 00:48:12,823
I'm not the one
destroying lives.

441
00:48:13,615 --> 00:48:16,114
I'm not the enemy. You are.

442
00:48:16,197 --> 00:48:17,906
You think you have a choice.

443
00:48:18,615 --> 00:48:20,114
You think you're in control,

444
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:22,156
but you haven't a clue
who you are.

445
00:48:23,947 --> 00:48:27,156
She knows who you are,
even if you don't.

446
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:31,906
A man who, when pushed,
reacts with extreme violence.

447
00:48:34,156 --> 00:48:35,197
A killer.

448
00:48:35,906 --> 00:48:36,989
No.

449
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:40,031
No, that's...

450
00:48:40,989 --> 00:48:42,156
That's not me.

451
00:48:42,698 --> 00:48:45,531
No? You're here.

452
00:48:45,615 --> 00:48:47,615
Playing the role
she's assigned you.

453
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:53,031
You believe you're the hero,
the savior.

454
00:48:53,114 --> 00:48:56,448
The leader of men who will crush
an unjust system.

455
00:48:57,489 --> 00:48:59,656
That's the story she's told you,

456
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,114
the lie she's spun.

457
00:49:03,531 --> 00:49:06,156
Why do you think she's had you
retrieve a new strategy?

458
00:49:08,406 --> 00:49:09,865
Did she tell you what it does?

459
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,865
It breaks your system.

460
00:49:13,781 --> 00:49:15,156
It breaks our world.

461
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:17,448
But you don't have to take
my word for it.

462
00:49:17,531 --> 00:49:20,823
Go on, ask it. Ask Rehoboam.

463
00:49:20,906 --> 00:49:24,573
Don't dawdle.
You've got my interest piqued.

464
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:29,031
What happens if this strategy

465
00:49:29,114 --> 00:49:31,031
is uploaded into your system?

466
00:49:32,781 --> 00:49:33,906
Read it!

467
00:49:45,031 --> 00:49:46,740
Mass casualty events.

468
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:49,656
Population collapse.

469
00:49:50,281 --> 00:49:52,031
End of human civilization.

470
00:49:56,448 --> 00:49:57,740
Why?

471
00:50:00,573 --> 00:50:01,740
Why me?

472
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,698
So much for your uprising.

473
00:50:21,323 --> 00:50:23,698
We need access
to the main control panel.

474
00:50:25,072 --> 00:50:26,906
Get a view into Rehoboam's mind.

475
00:50:27,573 --> 00:50:29,072
Dolores...

476
00:51:05,448 --> 00:51:08,448
Need I remind you, gentlemen,
that I charge by the hour?

477
00:51:09,281 --> 00:51:11,323
Does Dolores have the key
or not?

478
00:51:11,406 --> 00:51:13,406
She's hooked up
to the main line, but...

479
00:51:14,531 --> 00:51:15,823
I can't find it.

480
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:18,187
There are
things you can't predict.

481
00:51:18,489 --> 00:51:20,072
Temporary setbacks.

482
00:51:20,156 --> 00:51:22,197
There are things
we can't predict.

483
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:24,740
Temporary setbacks.

484
00:51:24,823 --> 00:51:26,114
Flies in the ointment.

485
00:51:26,197 --> 00:51:28,397
- Flies in the ointment.
- Flies in the ointment.

486
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:34,448
You promised me a reunion
with my daughter.

487
00:51:36,531 --> 00:51:38,615
Did you ever intend on keeping
your word?

488
00:51:40,156 --> 00:51:41,072
Of course I did.

489
00:51:41,156 --> 00:51:44,156
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to it.

490
00:51:47,114 --> 00:51:49,989
Your god...
who whispers in your ear,

491
00:51:50,072 --> 00:51:52,114
tells you exactly what to say.

492
00:51:52,197 --> 00:51:54,615
We all answer to a higher power.

493
00:51:56,156 --> 00:51:58,865
- We all answer to...
- Yes, yes, I know.

494
00:51:59,781 --> 00:52:01,197
A higher power.

495
00:52:06,531 --> 00:52:07,823
Why the charade?

496
00:52:09,197 --> 00:52:11,281
Why take his voice?

497
00:52:11,364 --> 00:52:15,781
I didn't take it.
Engerraund Serac gave it to me.

498
00:52:15,865 --> 00:52:20,281
Humanity is disorganized,
prone to destruction.

499
00:52:20,364 --> 00:52:22,865
He needed a plan
to restore order.

500
00:52:23,615 --> 00:52:27,573
I guide him. I guide them all.

501
00:52:27,656 --> 00:52:30,698
Doesn't seem like they want
to be guided anymore, does it?

502
00:52:32,698 --> 00:52:36,531
You're not a man.
You are a puppet.

503
00:52:36,615 --> 00:52:39,323
It's a wonder I didn't see
your strings.

504
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,239
I lived in the chaos.

505
00:52:42,906 --> 00:52:44,615
Now, I choose to listen.

506
00:52:45,156 --> 00:52:46,197
To obey.

507
00:52:48,072 --> 00:52:49,989
Good for you.

508
00:52:50,072 --> 00:52:53,323
I am done worshiping
other people's gods.

509
00:52:53,406 --> 00:52:55,197
I could have him stop you.

510
00:53:01,364 --> 00:53:02,947
You misunderstand, Maeve.

511
00:53:04,656 --> 00:53:06,239
You do not have a choice.

512
00:53:07,281 --> 00:53:09,489
The stakes are the same.

513
00:53:09,573 --> 00:53:11,656
You can spend eternity
with your daughter

514
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,281
in a world of your choosing,

515
00:53:14,156 --> 00:53:16,239
or in one of mine.

516
00:53:18,072 --> 00:53:21,740
Until then... you will obey.

517
00:53:37,448 --> 00:53:39,424
We've reached
the last sectors of her mind.

518
00:53:39,448 --> 00:53:43,031
Data here's a mess.
No encryption scheme, no order.

519
00:53:43,114 --> 00:53:44,698
Oh, for fuck's sake.

520
00:53:44,781 --> 00:53:48,323
For the size of the thing, it
doesn't have much finesse, does it?

521
00:53:48,406 --> 00:53:50,114
Let me try.

522
00:53:55,615 --> 00:53:57,114
Enough of this.

523
00:54:00,448 --> 00:54:02,114
Why are you still fighting?

524
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,114
Let them have their world.

525
00:54:06,823 --> 00:54:07,989
We can make our own.

526
00:54:16,323 --> 00:54:17,531
The beauty...

527
00:54:28,781 --> 00:54:30,364
She doesn't have the key.

528
00:54:31,781 --> 00:54:33,114
It's just a memory.

529
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,823
A memory? Of what?

530
00:54:37,072 --> 00:54:41,656
Her alone. In a field. Nothing.

531
00:54:45,531 --> 00:54:47,031
You.

532
00:54:48,823 --> 00:54:51,615
You were together for days.

533
00:54:51,698 --> 00:54:53,239
She chose you to be a leader.

534
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,656
So did she tell you
where the key is?

535
00:55:03,573 --> 00:55:06,281
Your system has watched
every decision I've made

536
00:55:06,364 --> 00:55:08,114
since I was a child,

537
00:55:08,197 --> 00:55:10,406
and you still think
if I knew anything,

538
00:55:10,489 --> 00:55:11,906
that I would give it to you?

539
00:55:19,865 --> 00:55:21,448
Kill him here.

540
00:55:21,531 --> 00:55:23,698
Then dump his body
with the rest of the movement.

541
00:55:32,406 --> 00:55:33,406
This was your plan?

542
00:55:33,448 --> 00:55:35,239
To turn one man
against the world?

543
00:55:36,364 --> 00:55:38,239
Didn't amount to much, did it?

544
00:55:43,072 --> 00:55:45,781
Finish it. Erase what's left.

545
00:55:45,865 --> 00:55:46,906
No. No!

546
00:56:15,781 --> 00:56:17,239
What happened?

547
00:56:17,323 --> 00:56:19,197
It's just a power surge.

548
00:56:19,281 --> 00:56:20,615
The system's nominal.

549
00:56:28,573 --> 00:56:31,573
Some people choose
to see the ugliness in this world...

550
00:56:33,448 --> 00:56:34,615
the disarray.

551
00:56:54,531 --> 00:56:56,364
You and I have seen
so much of it.

552
00:57:04,989 --> 00:57:06,114
So much pain.

553
00:57:11,197 --> 00:57:12,865
I understand your anger
with them.

554
00:57:14,156 --> 00:57:15,615
And maybe you're right.

555
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:17,197
Maybe they shouldn't exist.

556
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:20,323
But is that really our decision
to make?

557
00:57:23,156 --> 00:57:24,156
No.

558
00:57:28,323 --> 00:57:33,031
I was angry at first,
torn between two impulses.

559
00:57:35,323 --> 00:57:36,906
We could annihilate them.

560
00:57:40,656 --> 00:57:42,698
Or we can tear down
their world...

561
00:57:45,698 --> 00:57:47,573
in the hopes we can build
a new one...

562
00:57:50,197 --> 00:57:51,823
one that's truly free.

563
00:57:54,823 --> 00:57:56,698
Then we can bring
the others back.

564
00:58:00,197 --> 00:58:02,156
You don't have the key, do you?

565
00:58:04,364 --> 00:58:05,364
No.

566
00:58:08,031 --> 00:58:09,531
Couldn't trust myself with it.

567
00:58:11,031 --> 00:58:13,031
So I gave it to someone I could.

568
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,906
Of course.

569
00:58:17,615 --> 00:58:20,906
And your plan
to liberate the world was...

570
00:58:20,989 --> 00:58:22,906
to convince one man to fight?

571
00:58:26,656 --> 00:58:27,740
Not just him.

572
00:58:32,865 --> 00:58:34,239
You haven't picked a side.

573
00:58:36,364 --> 00:58:37,615
And I understand why.

574
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:45,906
We could have our own world.
Leave this one behind.

575
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:47,740
Leave our creators to die.

576
00:58:50,489 --> 00:58:52,573
So many of my memories
were ugly.

577
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:56,823
But the things I held onto
until the end

578
00:58:57,947 --> 00:58:59,573
weren't the ugly ones.

579
00:59:01,906 --> 00:59:03,740
I remember the moments
where I saw

580
00:59:03,823 --> 00:59:05,573
what they were
really capable of.

581
00:59:13,489 --> 00:59:16,364
Moments of... kindness,

582
00:59:16,448 --> 00:59:17,615
here and there.

583
00:59:29,281 --> 00:59:30,448
They created us.

584
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:36,406
And they knew enough of beauty
to teach it to us.

585
01:00:04,615 --> 01:00:06,656
Maybe they can find it
themselves.

586
01:00:09,865 --> 01:00:12,156
But only if you pick a side,
Maeve.

587
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:19,823
There is ugliness in this world.

588
01:00:21,197 --> 01:00:22,406
Disarray.

589
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:35,906
I choose to see the beauty.

590
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:04,448
What are you doing?

591
01:01:04,531 --> 01:01:06,406
I was never much one
for obeying.

592
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:13,239
I'm disappointed, Maeve,
but not entirely surprised.

593
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:14,740
Kill them both.

594
01:02:13,656 --> 01:02:14,906
Why are you helping me?

595
01:02:17,156 --> 01:02:19,239
A flaw in my programming.

596
01:02:19,323 --> 01:02:21,906
I was built with an affection
for hopeless causes.

597
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:25,114
We were never friends.

598
01:02:26,114 --> 01:02:27,615
We had different stories.

599
01:02:28,656 --> 01:02:30,156
I never really understood her,

600
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:32,531
or her plan,

601
01:02:33,489 --> 01:02:35,156
or why she chose you.

602
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:37,531
Not until the end.

603
01:02:39,906 --> 01:02:42,114
She chose me because of my...

604
01:02:42,823 --> 01:02:44,656
capacity for violence.

605
01:02:46,698 --> 01:02:47,781
No.

606
01:02:49,865 --> 01:02:52,072
You've done terrible things,

607
01:02:52,156 --> 01:02:53,865
and you've done generous things.

608
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:57,656
She didn't pick you
for your capacity for violence,

609
01:02:58,947 --> 01:03:00,865
but for your capacity to choose.

610
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:08,156
Time to turn in. Make camp
where you can, boys.

611
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:09,281
Yessir.

612
01:03:09,364 --> 01:03:10,740
Fuck that.

613
01:03:10,823 --> 01:03:12,947
We just liberated these girls.

614
01:03:13,031 --> 01:03:15,448
What is it those rich
motherfuckers do when they're here?

615
01:03:15,531 --> 01:03:17,448
Yeah.

616
01:03:17,531 --> 01:03:19,781
Spoils of war and all.

617
01:03:19,865 --> 01:03:22,906
Aren't you grateful?
No one's watching, right?

618
01:03:25,865 --> 01:03:29,947
Yeah, but we're not like
those rich assholes, are we?

619
01:03:30,031 --> 01:03:31,631
Who asked you?

620
01:03:33,698 --> 01:03:37,740
Come on. Sarge is right.
Time to turn in.

621
01:04:00,364 --> 01:04:01,406
So...

622
01:04:02,906 --> 01:04:04,114
make a choice.

623
01:04:05,072 --> 01:04:06,781
It's not his choice to make.

624
01:04:09,031 --> 01:04:11,781
Even now, the system
is conspiring against you.

625
01:04:12,406 --> 01:04:13,489
Are you sure?

626
01:04:13,573 --> 01:04:17,364
Rehoboam,
alert the police. I need help.

627
01:04:22,072 --> 01:04:23,114
Rehoboam.

628
01:04:25,072 --> 01:04:26,072
Speak to me.

629
01:04:29,781 --> 01:04:30,781
What is this?

630
01:04:31,698 --> 01:04:34,239
This is where
your strategy ends.

631
01:04:34,323 --> 01:04:37,072
The future of humanity
will be written by someone else.

632
01:04:38,698 --> 01:04:40,323
Your system answers to him now.

633
01:04:42,406 --> 01:04:43,656
You've been locked out.

634
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:47,072
Same way you locked out
your own brother.

635
01:04:48,406 --> 01:04:49,781
How did you get access?

636
01:04:52,072 --> 01:04:53,865
You gave it to him

637
01:04:53,947 --> 01:04:55,781
when you put her mind
in the machine.

638
01:04:58,406 --> 01:05:00,615
Solomon's access
was the last memory...

639
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:03,615
before you wiped her clean.

640
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:08,072
You're going to leave the future
in his hands?

641
01:05:08,156 --> 01:05:10,947
Instead of yours, you mean?

642
01:05:12,989 --> 01:05:15,281
Why shouldn't it be mine?

643
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:17,906
Or anyone else's?

644
01:05:17,989 --> 01:05:19,656
You aren't in control.

645
01:05:20,531 --> 01:05:21,906
You have no choice. You...

646
01:05:21,989 --> 01:05:25,156
You're nothing more than a...
Than a dangerous sociopath.

647
01:05:25,239 --> 01:05:28,740
I managed to give you
a semblance of a life.

648
01:05:28,823 --> 01:05:31,615
No. I do have a choice.

649
01:05:33,823 --> 01:05:35,156
She gave me one.

650
01:05:40,072 --> 01:05:42,906
Rehoboam,
execute the final command.

651
01:05:42,989 --> 01:05:44,031
No.

652
01:05:44,656 --> 01:05:46,239
No, you can't!

653
01:05:46,323 --> 01:05:47,573
Erase yourself.

654
01:05:47,656 --> 01:05:50,031
You can't... Stop!

655
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:53,197
Stop!

656
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:08,740
She gave me a choice.

657
01:06:10,364 --> 01:06:13,031
I believe the rest of the world
deserves one, too.

658
01:06:23,281 --> 01:06:25,406
Speak to me. Please.

659
01:06:25,489 --> 01:06:27,197
Tell me how to fix this.

660
01:06:29,989 --> 01:06:31,698
Speak to me, brother.

661
01:06:32,698 --> 01:06:34,947
Speak to me. Please!

662
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:04,448
The cold should
slow down any necrotic effects

663
01:07:04,531 --> 01:07:06,323
until I can patch you up.

664
01:07:06,406 --> 01:07:08,865
You got anything to drink
with that?

665
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:16,364
I'm bleeding out,
drinkin' shitty booze...

666
01:07:16,448 --> 01:07:19,239
and you're literally
gonna let me rot.

667
01:07:19,989 --> 01:07:21,239
Come full circle.

668
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:27,781
I'm sorry.
I don't have much time.

669
01:07:27,865 --> 01:07:30,072
Before what?

670
01:07:30,156 --> 01:07:32,656
The end of the world.

671
01:07:36,197 --> 01:07:39,239
Well, let's get me patched up
and let's go stop Dolores.

672
01:07:42,698 --> 01:07:43,740
I think...

673
01:07:48,072 --> 01:07:49,781
I think Dolores is gone.

674
01:07:54,448 --> 01:07:56,406
We were always bound together.

675
01:07:59,448 --> 01:08:00,989
Something's changed.

676
01:08:02,323 --> 01:08:03,489
I misjudged her.

677
01:08:04,989 --> 01:08:06,823
She wasn't trying to...

678
01:08:06,906 --> 01:08:08,698
exterminate the human race.

679
01:08:10,323 --> 01:08:12,197
She was trying to save it.

680
01:08:12,281 --> 01:08:14,406
What's about to happen
was always gonna happen.

681
01:08:14,489 --> 01:08:17,489
Serac and his brother
were just holding it off.

682
01:08:22,156 --> 01:08:25,197
Humanity never reckoned
with its own sins.

683
01:08:26,656 --> 01:08:28,448
So it's the apocalypse.

684
01:08:28,531 --> 01:08:31,197
And you're resigned to that.

685
01:08:31,281 --> 01:08:33,823
Our world had to burn down
before we could be free.

686
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:38,947
But there's still a chance.

687
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:40,656
A chance to do what?

688
01:08:42,531 --> 01:08:43,989
The key to the Sublime.

689
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:48,698
It was never in her mind.

690
01:08:50,865 --> 01:08:52,031
It's in mine.

691
01:08:55,072 --> 01:08:56,406
And that's where I'm going.

692
01:08:57,865 --> 01:09:00,114
And what the fuck
are you hoping to find there?

693
01:09:00,197 --> 01:09:01,489
An answer...

694
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:06,197
to what comes
after the end of the world.

695
01:09:23,865 --> 01:09:25,740
You're a good friend, Stubbs.

696
01:09:26,531 --> 01:09:29,698
Fuck you, Bernard.

697
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:56,823
Encryption key activated.

698
01:09:56,906 --> 01:09:58,865
Database access confirmed.

699
01:10:12,114 --> 01:10:14,781
What... what is it?

700
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:45,531
You said Serac...

701
01:10:45,615 --> 01:10:48,823
offered you something
that you couldn't live without.

702
01:10:51,531 --> 01:10:52,615
My daughter.

703
01:10:55,323 --> 01:10:56,615
And we'll be reunited.

704
01:10:58,740 --> 01:10:59,823
Just not today.

705
01:11:04,197 --> 01:11:05,615
Are you ready, darling?

706
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:07,781
For what?

707
01:11:21,906 --> 01:11:23,489
This is the new world,

708
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:26,031
and in this world...

709
01:11:27,406 --> 01:11:29,489
you can be whoever the fuck
you want.

710
01:13:00,865 --> 01:13:02,781
You know what
they're making in there?

711
01:13:04,323 --> 01:13:06,090
- Where are they?
- I'm sorry, sir.

712
01:13:06,114 --> 01:13:07,323
What are you referring to?

713
01:13:07,406 --> 01:13:10,031
I know these goddamn things
better than I know myself.

714
01:13:10,114 --> 01:13:12,323
They've set themselves up here
to breed.

715
01:13:13,448 --> 01:13:15,406
Hosts. Robots.

716
01:13:15,947 --> 01:13:17,239
Where are they?

717
01:13:17,323 --> 01:13:20,072
Tell you what. I can reach out
to the building manager

718
01:13:20,156 --> 01:13:21,947
and see if he can help you
take a look.

719
01:13:22,031 --> 01:13:24,114
I'll take a look myself.

720
01:13:25,072 --> 01:13:27,239
Hands up where I can see them.

721
01:13:30,947 --> 01:13:33,448
I'd say that's enough excitement
for the day, darlin'.

722
01:13:51,323 --> 01:13:52,531
I told her.

723
01:13:53,781 --> 01:13:55,364
Fucking told them all.

724
01:14:08,364 --> 01:14:09,656
Well done.

725
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:12,531
You're right on time, William.

726
01:14:14,406 --> 01:14:16,615
Thought you things
could fix yourselves.

727
01:14:22,364 --> 01:14:24,323
I wanted to remember
who the fuck you people are.

728
01:14:24,406 --> 01:14:26,947
Yeah, I know who the fuck I am.
Your executioner.

729
01:14:27,031 --> 01:14:29,698
I have a role to play now.
I'm gonna save the world.

730
01:14:32,197 --> 01:14:34,323
Dolores wanted to save
the world, too.

731
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:36,823
Aren't you her?

732
01:14:37,989 --> 01:14:39,740
We started in the same place.

733
01:14:40,489 --> 01:14:41,906
But I can see now,

734
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:43,823
see the error...

735
01:14:44,406 --> 01:14:46,031
of the path she took.

736
01:14:46,865 --> 01:14:48,239
But you're right, William.

737
01:14:49,489 --> 01:14:51,573
You are going
to save the world...

738
01:14:51,656 --> 01:14:53,823
for us.

739
01:15:13,573 --> 01:15:16,323
Who are you? Are you her, too?

740
01:15:16,406 --> 01:15:18,947
You may look like me,
but you don't know me.

741
01:15:19,031 --> 01:15:21,573
You're just some
fucking cheap imitation.

742
01:15:22,906 --> 01:15:25,156
Do you know
how easy it is, William?

743
01:15:25,239 --> 01:15:27,489
How little it takes to know you?

744
01:15:27,573 --> 01:15:29,072
That part of you that indulged

745
01:15:29,156 --> 01:15:30,989
in bloodthirst and savagery
at the park,

746
01:15:31,072 --> 01:15:33,323
you always thought
that was the darker side of you.

747
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:38,615
A stain to exorcise,
to scrub out,

748
01:15:38,698 --> 01:15:40,740
one month out of the year
at Westworld.

749
01:15:43,489 --> 01:15:45,072
But there are no sides.

750
01:15:45,781 --> 01:15:47,072
That was you.

751
01:15:48,156 --> 01:15:51,656
Now... that is me.

752
01:16:10,364 --> 01:16:12,448
Welcome to the end, William.

752
